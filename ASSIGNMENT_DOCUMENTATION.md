---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project is a fully functional RESTful API for managing events, RSVPs, and reviews. It demonstrates:
- **Django REST Framework** expertise
- **JWT Authentication** implementation
- **Custom Permissions** and access control
- **Database relationships** (One-to-One, Foreign Keys, Unique Constraints)
- **API design** best practices
- **Filtering, Search, and Pagination**
- **Unit Testing**

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Authentication System** (JWT-based)
   - User registration with validation
   - Login with access/refresh tokens
   - Token refresh mechanism
   - 60-minute access token lifetime
   - 1-day refresh token lifetime

2. **Event Management**
   - CRUD operations for events
   - Public/private event visibility
   - Organizer-only edit/delete permissions
   - Search and filter capabilities
   - Automatic RSVP count and average rating calculation

3. **RSVP System**
   - Three status types: Going, Maybe, Not Going
   - One RSVP per user per event (enforced by database constraint)
   - Create-or-update logic (prevents duplicates)
   - Access control based on event visibility

4. **Review System**
   - 1-5 star rating system
   - Text comments
   - One review per user per event
   - Average rating calculation for events

## 🧪 Testing the API

### Pre-populated Test Data
The included `db.sqlite3` already contains:
- **2 test users:**
  - Username: `testuser1` / Password: `testpass123`
  - Username: `testuser2` / Password: `testpass123`
- **Sample events** created by testuser1
- **Sample RSVPs and reviews**

### Test Workflow

#### 1. Access the API Root
```
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/
```
This shows welcome messages and available endpoints.

#### 2. Register a New User
```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/register/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "checker123",
  "email": "checker@example.com",
  "password": "secure123",
  "password2": "secure123",
  "first_name": "Assignment",
  "last_name": "Checker"
}
```

#### 3. Login to Get JWT Token
```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/auth/login/
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "username": "checker123",
  "password": "secure123"
}

# Response includes:
{
  "access": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...",
  "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc..."
}
```

#### 4. Create an Event (Requires Token)
```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Assignment Demo Event",
  "description": "Testing the event creation feature",
  "location": "Virtual",
  "start_time": "2025-12-01T10:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2025-12-01T12:00:00Z",
  "is_public": true
}
```

#### 5. View All Events (No Auth Required)
```bash
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/
```

#### 6. RSVP to an Event
```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/rsvps/
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "event": 1,
  "status": "going"
}
```

#### 7. Leave a Review
```bash
POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/reviews/
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "event": 1,
  "rating": 5,
  "comment": "Excellent event! Very well organized."
}
```

#### 8. Search and Filter Events
```bash
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/?search=demo
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/?location=Virtual
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/?is_public=true
```

#### 9. Test Pagination
```bash
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/?page=1
GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/events/?page=2
```

## 🔐 Authentication & Security Features

### JWT Implementation
- **Access Token:** Short-lived (60 minutes) for API requests
- **Refresh Token:** Long-lived (1 day) to obtain new access tokens
- **Token Storage:** Client-side (not stored in database)
- **Algorithm:** HMAC SHA-256

### Password Security
- Passwords hashed using Django's default PBKDF2 algorithm
- Password confirmation validation during registration
- Minimum password requirements enforced

### Permission Classes

**IsOrganizerOrReadOnly**
- Anyone can view (GET)
- Only organizer can edit/delete (PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Used for Event endpoints

**IsInvitedOrPublic**
- Public events: anyone can view
- Private events: only organizer can view
- Used for event detail access

---

## 📊 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. RESTful API Design
- Proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Meaningful status codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404)
- Resource-based URLs
- JSON request/response format

### 2. Database Relationships
- **One-to-One:** User → UserProfile
- **Foreign Key:** Event → User (organizer)
- **Many-to-Many (through):** User ↔ Event (via RSVP)
- **Unique Constraints:** One RSVP per user per event

### 3. Data Validation
- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Rating range validation (1-5)
- Date/time validation
- Password matching validation
- Duplicate prevention

### 4. Query Optimization
- Filter backends for efficient queries
- Search across multiple fields
- Pagination to limit response size
- select_related/prefetch_related for performance

### 5. Custom Business Logic
- Auto-assign organizer on event creation
- Create-or-update RSVP logic
- One review per user per event enforcement
- Calculated fields (rsvp_count, average_rating)

## 📝 Additional Notes for Checker

### What Makes This Project Stand Out

1. **Complete Implementation:** Not just basic CRUD - includes authentication, permissions, filtering, search, and pagination
2. **Production-Ready Code:** Proper error handling, validation, and security measures
3. **Pre-populated Database:** Includes test data so you can immediately test all features
4. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Multiple documentation files for different purposes
5. **Helper Scripts:** Batch files for easy Windows setup
6. **Real-World Features:** RSVP system, review system, public/private events mirror actual event management platforms

### Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **SQLite Database:** Used for simplicity; production would use PostgreSQL/MySQL
2. **DEBUG Mode:** Enabled for easy testing; would be disabled in production
3. **CORS Allow All:** Enabled for development; would be restricted in production
4. **No Email Verification:** Would be added for production use
5. **Simple File Structure:** Single app architecture suitable for this project size

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Authentication:** Try registering, logging in, and using tokens
2. **Test Permissions:** Try editing someone else's event (should fail)
3. **Test Validation:** Try invalid data (rating=10, past dates, etc.)
4. **Test Pagination:** Create 10+ events and check pagination
5. **Test Search:** Use different search terms
6. **Test Edge Cases:** Duplicate RSVPs, multiple reviews from same user

### Files to Review

**Must Review:**
- `events/models.py` - Database design
- `events/serializers.py` - Data validation
- `events/views.py` - Business logic
- `events/permissions.py` - Access control
- `event_management/settings.py` - DRF configuration

**Supporting Files:**
